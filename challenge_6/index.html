                    Renowned Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1969 Davis began working in an advertising agency, where he assisted in creating Tom Ryan's
                    comic strip, Tumbleweeds. Later he created a comic strip, Gnorm Gnat, that ran for five years
                    in The Pendleton Times, an Indiana newspaper. When Davis attempted to sell it to a national 
                    comic strip syndicate, an editor told him that although it was a good laugh with great art, 
                    no one would relate to bugs! On September 17, 1988 Davis released the first Garfield cartoon,
                    which is now incredibly popular receiving many movies, shows and toys.In the 1980s, Davis
                    created the barnyard slapstick comic strip U.S. Acres. Although not as popular as Garfield,
                    U.S. Acres still had a large crowd and even had a toy of one of its characters show up in the
                    kids movie Toy Story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Praise Recieved
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having created a national treasure it was without a doubt that Davis would receive great praise
                    for his creations. Jim Davis won has won various Emmy Awards, Awards for Outstanding Animated 
                    Program,
                    However not many could have predicted that Davis would receive praise from
                    then congressman Mike Pence, who has recently become the vice president of the United States.
